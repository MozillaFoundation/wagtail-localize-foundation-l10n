"The creepiest thing we found about HER is the section of their privacy policy where they state,\"With your permission, we will access your address book, call log and SMS log, and import your "
"contacts’ names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, image, geographic location and Facebook IDs to facilitate automatic connection with your friends.\" Basically, they want your permission to access a"
" whole lot of your personal information so they can try and get others to join the site. They'll even send your friends emails from you to invite them to join the site. That just feels creepy. Would"
" you give your neighbor access to your phone's contacts, location, pictures, and more and then let them email those people from you with a request to hang out? I sure wouldn't and I like my "
"neighbors. HER also pushes users to sign up with Facebook or Instagram, although users can now also sign up with their phone number or Apple login. When you connect a social media account like "
"Facebook to a dating app, both Facebook and the dating app now potentially collect more information together. That's why we recommend users don't link your dating app to Facebook. What could go "
"wrong on HER? You give them permission to access all your contacts and they start emailing people to join HER from your email account. Your Grandma, who you haven't come out to yet, gets an invite "
"from you to join a lesbian dating app, jumps out of her chair in a tizzy, trips over her cat and breaks her hip. No one wants Grandma to break her hip (or for you to get outed before you're ready)."
